    Thorin and Company were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf, and the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by Thorin
    Oakenshield in TA 2941. Their purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain from the dragon
    Smaug.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
